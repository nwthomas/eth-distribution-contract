# Ethereum Distribution Contract

The purpose of this contract is to allow users to contribute Ether and then distribute it back out evenly.

Here is the initial problem description:

> The smart contract accepts contributions in ETH from people and then divides the ETH up evenly and distributes it to the people who contributed.
>
> The maximum contribution per address is 10 ETH and should be configurable, but only be able to be changed by the owner of the contract.
>
> The owner should be able to transfer ownership to someone else of their choice."
